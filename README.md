# VideoGame Data Trends

This is is a jupyter notebook with exploration of a data set involving in-game purchases from certain users, as well as information about 
the age and gender of the users.  

Three trends I noticed in the data were all pretty predictable. 
Male users were the vast majority of the player base and as a result spent a lot more money than
females or other/ Non-disclosed genders.  The female's had a higher average purchase price per person,
which is interesting.  Aside from gender observations, the majority of users were ages 20-24 and 
were responsible for the majority of the money taken in. User count had a bell-curve shape across the ages
with most users around 15 to 24, then dropping off after that.
